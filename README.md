## Implementing Perceptron for Spam Classification

Deep Learning is arguably one of the most popular aspect of machine learning anyways, but it is important to understand the very foundation of artificial neural network, which is the Perceptron.

In traditional machine learning, the Perceptron is a linear machine learning algorithm for binary classification tasks.

We aim to implement perceptron for spam classification as spam filtering incorporates binary classification of data using a dataset available in Kaggle.

We also compare the performance of our model with other models used in the project from which the dataset has been used.
